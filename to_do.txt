GENERAL:
- Improve libft?
- Check if MLX config in Makefile is correct
- Check if input validation handles everything
- Norminette
- Leak checks

NEXT STEPS:
- Make camera adjustable, create viewport
- Handle window resizing

AFTER THAT:
- Add ambient light
- Add lights

From the subject:
- Your program must be able to resize the objectâ€™s unique properties: diameter for a
sphere and the width and height for a cylinder.
- Your program must be able to apply translation and rotation transformation to
objects, lights and cameras (except for spheres and lights that cannot be rotated).
- Light management: spot brightness, hard shadows, ambiance lighting (objects are
never completely in the dark). You must implement Ambient and diffuse lighting.

Questions:
- Is there a difference between ambient and diffuse lighting?
- What is meant by translation and rotation transformation?
- Do they mean resize as the window is open? Like add key hooks for this?

PARSER:
- Spaces after a line give error, do we want this?
