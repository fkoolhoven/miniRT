To do:
- Debug, edge cases
- Give parser some weird inputs
- Check if MLX config in Makefile is correct / figure out how we want to do this on intra
- Add maps for testing and eval
- Make resize more efficient?
- No light can reach: cylinder caps?
- Adjust hooks for round look?
- Check object parameters in parser
- What if light inside object?

Final:
- Leak
- Norminette
